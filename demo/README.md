# Plants-vs-Zombies
Some vision on popular game in C++ SFML Framework.

- The game has 2 warring parties: zombies and plants.  The task of zombies – to get to the left end of the field, the task of plants – do not let them do it. Plants can shoot plants (peas, cabbage, Actinia ) and cause damage to zombies, or serve as a shield(sunflower, nut, bomb).Zombies in turn can eat plants. If the plants on a certain line have not coped with their task, then they come to the aid of cars that are guaranteed to kill all the zombies that are currently on the line. Setting plants on the field is not free. Every 5 seconds, 50 “suns” are generated, which can be spent on plants. If all the zombies on the map are defeated, then a picture is displayed, signaling the victory of plants. If at least one of the zombies reached the end of the map, the zombies won.
